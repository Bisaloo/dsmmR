# dsmmR 1.0.1

## Minor Improvements

* Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.

* Updated the README with high-level documentation of the package and installation instructions. 

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a case where simulate.dsmm() did not function as expected when nsim = 1. Now nsim is also allowed to be 0. Updated the documentation corresponding to these changes.
