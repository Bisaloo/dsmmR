Description: Performs non-parametric estimation and simulation from 
    parametric and non-parametric model specifications, that concern
    (multi-state) discrete-time Drifting Semi-Markov processes.
    Three different models are possible, regarding the number of transition
    matrices and sojourn time distributions used for the computation of
    the Semi-Markov kernels, which describe the Drifting Semi-Markov kernel.
    For the parametric specification several discrete distributions are 
    considered for the sojourn times: Uniform, Geometric, Poisson,
    Discrete Weibull and Negative Binomial.
    For the non-parametric counterpart, no assumptions are done on the shape
    of the sojourn time distributions.
    Semi-Markov models are described in:
